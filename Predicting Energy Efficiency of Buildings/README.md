we will develop a multivariate multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on two output variables, which are the heating load and the cooling load, of residential buildings.
you will learn about simple linear regression and the different assumptions made by simple linear regression models.
you will learn about multiple linear regression and assumptions made by multiple linear regression models.
you will learn about different evaluation metrics for measuring regression performance.
ou will learn about regularization as a method to make complex models simpler by penalising coefficients to reduce their magnitude, variance in the training set and in turn, reduce overfitting in the model.
